# About

DiscID.org is the documentation site for the Disc ID specification, a proposed standard for recording data about a disc golf disc onto a Near Field Communication (NFC) tag on the disc.

The documentation is primarily maintained by Zach Hyatt (PDGA #27534) with the source code available on GitHub for suggestions and collaboration: https://github.com/Disc-ID/discid.org.

The details of the specification are covered by the [MIT License](https://github.com/Disc-ID/discid.org/LICENSE.md).
