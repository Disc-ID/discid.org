# Enabling true ownership with Disc ID

A video was recently posted by [Discgolf.law](https://discgolf.law) on their YouTube channel titled [Who Legally Owns a Lost Disc?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llc6YU2bDvA). The video walks through this topic by answering a set of questions submitted to them by Robbie Boros, using the loss of a hypothetical $2,000 Nate Sexton Firebird to break down some related legal terms and conditions, and how they might apply.

Just based on the title I knew this would be a very relevant discussion for the Disc ID standard. This is because one of the biggest benefits of having NFC tags embedded in discs is the ability to have a unique identifier per disc and use that to track ownership through a [registry](the-registry.md).

Given the potential areas of confusion around who legally possesses a disc that is lost and subsequently found, let's walk through the same questions Chris Clark went over in this video and see how Disc ID might be related.

## Possession is 9/10 of the Law?

> I see a lot of arguments back and forth regarding lost discs. I see a lot of people claiming abandonment laws or stating that possession is 9/10 of the law, but I wanted to find out what the reality of this is.

Chris quickly establishes that the concept of possession being 9/10 of the law doesn't really apply to lost golf discs. That is the idea that "custody presumes ownership", or in other words, that in most cases if you come into possession of an item then you own it.

When you break it down like that it seems pretty absurd for our scenario and we will just move on satisfied that Disc ID doesn't need to bring its powers in here.

## Burden of Proof

> Does placing my name and phone number on my golf disc prove ownership?

This question points to the concept of burden of proof, which Chris discusses by walking through three common standards of proof that are recognized by the law:

1. **Beyond a resonable doubt** - primarily used in criminal cases because it is the highest standard of burden, requiring no other reasonable explanation to exist
1. **Clear and convincing** - typically used in civil matters and is lower than beyond a resonable doubt
1. **Preponderance of evidence** - used in most civil lawsuits and the threshold is considered to be met when there is a greater than 50% chance a claim is true

Although there isn't further discussion of how these standards might play into the scenario of the lost Firebird, Chris mentions that if you had your name and phone number on the disc then it would be "pretty persuasive in your favor".

But what if someone is able to wipe off, ink over or otherwise cover up what you put on the disc? Perhaps there is a chance you can convince others that it was your name originally on the disc and you should still be the owner, but in that scenario you could be failing to even meet the lowest threshold of a preponderance of evidence.

On the other hand, if that disc was Disc ID enabled with an entry in the online [registry](/registry) that showed you as the owner, then no matter what else is done to any markings on the disc, you are likely near the top of the proof ladder of beyond a reasonable doubt.

## Lost, Abandoned, or Mislaid?

> If I lose a disc and it lies in an area that prevents retrieval under normal circumstances, such as a body of water, is it considered lost? What are the legal aspects of this situation and at what point would it be considered abandoned as opposed to lost?

There are a few key terms that Chris walks through to provide more clarity around this question. "Lost" and "Mislaid" are discussed and are very similar, basically property that was unintentionally left behind by its true owner (e.g. the disc fell out of your bag on the course).

There notes about how common law gives superior rights to the original owner of the lost item and how statutory procedures in many states allow the finder to take ownership of the item if they advertise or try to notify the original owner. But the real value with Disc ID likely comes in with relation to abandoned items.

"Abandonment" is the final key term covered and the most important one: "if mislaid or lost items are abandoned the finder may retain the item and claim its ownership". Essentially, if an item could be deemed abandoned, then you no longer have a claim on ownership, whoever possesses it does.

Chris mentions that "the key attribute here in abandonment is that the original owner must demonstrate an unquivocal intent to abandon the property" and that the intent can be inferred from behavior such as when you stop looking for the item and leave the area.

But he does go on to note that temporarily stopping to look doesn't automatically mean abandoned. So what if there was a way to signal your intent to keep looking for the disc? That you still wanted it back?

That is exactly what the registry can help with. Not only could your Disc ID enabled disc be assigned to you in the registry, it could also have a status attached to it to help strengthen your claim to ownership in these scenarios. Something like "Lost but still looking - NDLB" (No Disc Left Behind).

## Legal Obligations

> What obligations does someone finding the disc have? Do they have a legal obligation to make attempts to return the disc?

This is an area where Disc ID can act as a deterrent to those who might not otherwise return your disc. According to Chris, some states claim you are guilty of theft if you find lost property and have a reasonable way to get it back to the original owner, but make no attempt to do so.

With a registry there will always be a reasonable way to contact the original owner, so the finder won't be able to claim they had no method of contacting.

> While some will see a lost disc as trivial, what obligations does the owner of the disc face in terms of reporting that the disc is lost? And to whom would they report it if required?

To avoid abandonment, Chris mentioned having your name and phone number on the disc, posting a flyer at the course about the lost disc or posting on an online group. We covered above how you could report your disc as "Lost" in the registry, so Disc ID would help standardize this, making it an easy way to prevent these abandonment scenarios.


## The Case for Disc ID

The [Discgolf.law](https://discgolf.law) team did a great job of breaking down the legal considerations around lost and found discs. And after working through how Disc ID relates to these issues of ownership, I think there is a clear benefit here.

Does Disc ID fix all the potential problems with handling lost discs? It definitely doesn't, but it could help add a layer of protection when you do purchase a Disc ID enabled 2025 Nate Sexton Tour series Firebird for $2,000 on eBay and promptly lose it in the shule on your first throw.

Let's just hope that is never a realistic scenario. ü•è
