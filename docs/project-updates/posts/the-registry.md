# The Registry

After [Introducting the Disc ID Project](https://discid.org/project-updates/2023/11/30/introducing-the-disc-id-project/), it became clear that more explanation was needed about the benefits of having disc-related data on a NFC tag embedded in the disc. If the data only exists on the disc there are a few use cases, such as more detailed identification of runs of discs you like and an easier method for identifying the specific details of a poorly marked disc (manufacturer, mold, plastic, etc.), but these aren't the most interesting.

The more powerful benefits only become available once the unique identifier on the disc gets connected to other information available online. And that is where the registry comes in.

**The basic concept**

In a nutshell, the Registry would have the same data as the NFC tags embedded in the discs have. Then using the unique identifier, each disc would be associated with an account that becomes the owner of the disc. Initially each disc would be owned by the account of the manfucturer who produced it, but then ownership can be changed to a retailer or player account when they purchase the disc.

**Extending the data**

Once a disc is in the system, additional information can be attached to a disc beyond just who the owner is. There are a ton of details that could be tracked, but one of the simpler things is the status of the disc. A couple statuses that might be of interest include:

- **STOLEN** - the owner is claiming the disc has been stolen and they want it back
- **LOST** - the owner lost the disc and they would like it back
- **ENJOY** - the owner kept shanking the disc deep in the woods and decided to gift it to the world after spending too much time searching (or they intentionally left that misbehaving piece of plastic to curse someone else)

Anyone who scans that disc could see the status and act accordingly, including retailers who might be considering buying used discs for resale and can see if they are marked as stolen, for example.

**More to explore**

By having a Disc ID standard and manufacturers embedding the tags into discs, the foundation is set for the above benefits and features to be explored. But that may only be the start of the interesting applications of a registry like this.
