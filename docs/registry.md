# Registry

One major benefit Disc ID can bring to the industry includes a registry for discs that have embedded tags. In order to work, the tags must have a unique identifier for each disc which is currently included in the Disc ID proposed standard.

At a very high level, the registry would likely consist of:

- Database containing data from the tags embedded in the discs
- Platform for managing authenticated accounts for various entities with different capabilities/permissions
- API for accessing and managing entries in the database based on authenticated account details
- Web, mobile and/or desktop software for managing inventory

With these elements in place, discs can be added to the registry and ownership of them gets attached to a registry account. Manufacturers would add discs and ownership would be transferred to retailers or players when they purchase them.

Establishing a registry would take some effort, but once it is available the following benefits could be possible:

- **Ink-free disc ownership** - contact information can be stored and retrieved via the registry, or handled partly or entirely server-side, so discs don't need to be marked for ownership
- **Stronger disc authenticity** - validating the authenticity of discs, especially special and limited runs, becomes easier and more reliable for collectors
- **Stolen discs** - discs in the registry can have a stolen status associated with them, so retailers won't buy used ones that have been stolen
- **Lost and found** - disc status can also be used to mark discs as lost, potentially with information about where they were lost, to help aid in recovery

Although building a registry is currently outside of the scope of this project, more details about the concept will be shared as progress on the Disc ID specification continues.
